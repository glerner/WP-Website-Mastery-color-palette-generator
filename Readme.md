# Color Palette Generator Project

The GL Color Palette Generator MVP focuses on creating a functional color palette system with AI assistance and WordPress theme integration. The core functionality includes
* AI-Assisted Color Generation
  * Questionnaire for gathering business/brand context
  * AI generation of color palettes that will look good for this business with these clients
  * Return of Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and Accent colors with hex values and names
* Manual Color Management
  * Manual entry of the four core colors, and automatic fill-in any missing colors (using a selection from a list of common color harmonies)
  * Automatic generation of color variations (should call them tints/shades, since also using "WordPress Theme Variations")
    * Correct luminance ordering (white  → lighter → light → clear-gap-between-light-and-dark → dark → darker → black)
  * Color variations have contrast checking against white or black text, required to exceed WCAG AAA color contrast
    * color contrast should be between minimal AAA and WCAG maximum recommended contrast,
    * adjustable luminance target levels for lighter, light, dark, darker
* Extended Color Set
  * Addition of utility colors (error, warning, success)
  * Neutral color variations
* Display and Preview
  * Visual display of the complete color palette
  * Sample content preview with lorem ipsum text
  * Preview of different color combinations
* WordPress Integration
  * Export of color palettes as theme.json Theme Variations
  * Export of multiple theme variations (change the order of the generated colors, 6 combinations of primary, secondary and tertiary colors, or 24 combinations with accent colors )

# How to use

1. Import FlootSetup.css to set up the css variables and basic styles.
2. Import the components into your react codebase.

# Quick Start (Local)

* __Install dependencies__

```bash
npm install
```

* __Run the dev server__ (Vite on http://localhost:5173)

```bash
npm run dev
```

Keep the terminal running. Stop with Ctrl+C. After restarting your machine or IDE, run `npm run dev` again.

* __Build and preview production bundle__

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

# Environment and Configuration

Configuration is centralized in `helpers/config.ts`. Non-secret UI tuning can be overridden via `.env.local` using `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables.

Examples (create `./.env.local`):

```bash
# Accessibility thresholds (safe for client)
NEXT_PUBLIC_AAA_MIN_CONTRAST=7.05
NEXT_PUBLIC_AA_SMALL_MIN_CONTRAST=4.5

# Generation targets (safe for client)
NEXT_PUBLIC_TINT_TARGET_COUNT=10
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHADE_TARGET_COUNT=10
NEXT_PUBLIC_LIGHTER_MIN_Y=0.50
```

__Important__: Do NOT put secret API keys in `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables; they are exposed to the browser.

---

# API Keys (Secrets)

If you add AI-powered base color generation or other provider calls, keep keys server-side only.

Local development (never commit `.env.local`):

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
GEMINI_API_KEY=...
CLAUDE_API_KEY=...
```

Use these only in server code (API routes/functions). The browser should call your server endpoint, not the provider directly.

Production: set the same env vars in your hosting environment’s secret manager (e.g., Vercel/Netlify/Render dashboards, or your own server process manager). Do not expose secrets to the client.

---

# Development Workflow

* __Color math runs in the browser__ for instant feedback (see `helpers/colorUtils.tsx`).
* __Thresholds and ranges__ are centralized in `helpers/config.ts` and surfaced as short constants (e.g., `AAA_MIN`, `LIGHTER_MIN_Y`).
* __Server-side tasks__ (if added) should handle secrets and heavy operations (e.g., AI calls, ZIP export streaming).

Scripts in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite --port 5173",
    "build": "tsc -b && vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview --port 5173"
  }
}
```

# Exporting WordPress Theme Variations

The app supports exporting palettes as WordPress `theme.json` Theme Variations. Planned/desired behavior:

* __Single archive (ZIP)__ containing multiple theme variations.
* Each variation includes a `theme.json` and corresponding CSS.
* Variations may permute primary/secondary/tertiary (and optionally accent) roles.

See `endpoints/` and related helpers for export implementation details. If hosting within WordPress, you can proxy export via a WP REST endpoint and deliver the ZIP as a download.

---

# Troubleshooting

* __Port busy__: run `npm run dev -- --port 5174` and open http://localhost:5174
* __Env not applied__: confirm values are in `.env.local` (not committed) and restart `npm run dev`.
* __Type errors__: check recent edits in `helpers/ensureAAAContrast.tsx`, `helpers/colorUtils.tsx`, and `helpers/config.ts` for consistent imports/exports.
